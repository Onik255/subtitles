WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:03.421
Hope you boys are ready.

00:04.297 --> 00:05.840
Because the war has just begun.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.177
This is Special Agent Victor Henriksen.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.345
It's my job to bring you in.
Alive's a bonus.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.057
- Read them the charges.
- Armed robbery, kidnapping and murder.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.602
I'm the last person on planet Earth
you wanna spoon with.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.769
This is Ruby, huh?

00:19.270 --> 00:20.396
Never had the pleasure.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.231
I'm here because I wanna help you.

00:22.398 --> 00:25.943
She's a demon, Sam, period. All right?
They want us dead, we want them dead.

00:26.110 --> 00:29.447
Ruby here was a witch.
Of course, that was when you were human.

00:29.614 --> 00:32.283
You are Sam Winchester. The boy king.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.994
Sam was supposed to be
the grand Pooh-Bah and lead the army...

00:35.161 --> 00:37.288
...but he hasn't exactly
stepped up to the plate.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.041
There's a new leader rising
and doesn't like you much.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.084
Doesn't want the competition.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.420
There are a hundred more demons
out there now.

00:44.587 --> 00:47.548
Ain't enough hunters in the world
to handle something like this.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.719
- Bela stole the Colt.
- She got another one over on us.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.646
- How do you sleep?
- Rolling naked in money.

00:53.763 --> 00:55.806
Pack your crap.
We'll go hunt the bitch down.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.161
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.498
Sure this is Bela's room?

01:21.123 --> 01:22.250
I'd say so.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.560
Dean? Sweetie, are you there?

01:41.727 --> 01:42.770
Where are you?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.522
- Two states away by now.
- Where?

01:44.689 --> 01:46.524
Where's our usual quippy banter?
I miss it.

01:46.691 --> 01:48.484
I want it back, Bela. Now.

01:48.651 --> 01:51.320
The little pistol, you mean? Sorry.
I can't at the moment.

01:51.487 --> 01:54.031
You understand how many people
are gonna die if you do this?

01:54.198 --> 01:56.450
What exactly is it that you think
I plan to do with it?

01:56.617 --> 02:00.204
Take the only weapon we have against
demons and sell it to the highest bidder?

02:01.664 --> 02:02.999
You know nothing about me.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.292
I know I'm gonna stop you.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.419
Tough words for a guy
who can't even find me.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.713
Oh, I'll find you, sweetheart.

02:08.879 --> 02:12.008
You know why? Because I have
absolutely nothing better to do...

02:12.174 --> 02:13.467
...than to track you down.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.052
That's where you're wrong.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.471
You're about to be quite occupied.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.640
Did you really think
I wouldn't take precautions?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.728
- Hands in the air!
- Down on your knees.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.901
- Bitch.
- On the ground. Now.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.111
Do it.

02:32.278 --> 02:33.404
- Go!
- Unh!

02:33.571 --> 02:35.971
Sam and Dean Winchester,
you have the right to remain silent.

02:36.073 --> 02:39.368
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.245
You have the right to an attorney...

02:41.412 --> 02:43.748
...and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

02:43.914 --> 02:47.752
If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be
appointed for you at government expense.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.420
Hi, guys.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.548
It's been a while.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.524
So did you get them?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.109
I asked for all your men.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.403
And you got them.
They went with you on the raid.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.447
Four men. That's all.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.783
Everyone I could drum up
with an hour's notice.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.535
We're a small town, Agent Henriksen.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.606
- What's he in for?
- Drunk and disorderly.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.298
Keys.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.758
Now.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.845
What are you doing?

03:41.472 --> 03:43.933
It is your lucky night, sir.
You are free to go.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.518
What the hell are you doing?

03:45.684 --> 03:47.228
This way.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.481
Agent Henriksen,
you can't just release my prisoners.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.984
Agent Henriksen?

03:54.360 --> 03:57.530
- Look, I get it. You're Mayberry P.D.
- Excuse me?

03:57.696 --> 03:59.698
This isn't how I would do it
if I had my choice.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.493
But a tip's a tip
and we had to move fast.

04:02.660 --> 04:06.163
Look, agent. This ain't my first rodeo.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.833
You've never been to a rodeo
like this before.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.335
You have any idea
who we're about to bring in here?

04:11.502 --> 04:12.795
Yeah, a couple of fugitives.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.297
The most dangerous criminals
you've laid eyeballs on.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.341
Think Hannibal Lecter
and his half-wit brother.

04:17.508 --> 04:20.636
Do you know what these guys do for kicks?
Dig up graves and mutilate corpses.

04:20.803 --> 04:23.556
They're not just killers,
they're Satan-worshipping killers.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.015
So work with me here.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.601
I'll get them out of your hair
and on to Supermax...

04:27.768 --> 04:30.855
...and you'll be home in enough time
to watch the Farm Report.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.190
However we can help.

04:34.984 --> 04:36.777
Those men of yours.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.487
Post them at the exits.

04:39.238 --> 04:40.948
Yes, sir.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.826
- Reidy.
- Yeah, Vic?

04:43.993 --> 04:45.035
Bring them in.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.079
Guess we're as ready
as we're gonna be.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.415
Got it. On our way in.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.518
Why all the sourpusses?

05:11.687 --> 05:13.481
I'll show you to the cells.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.066
Hey, hey. Watch the merchandise.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.155
We're not the ones
you should be scared of, Nancy.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.586
Dean, come on.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.380
All right, all right. Sit?

05:38.756 --> 05:40.299
Yeah.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.437
How are we gonna Houdini
out of this one?

05:53.604 --> 05:55.105
Good question.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.863
It's me. Is Steven in?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.658
Well, get him out of the meeting.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.833
- Groves.
- I got them.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.460
Well, I'll be damned.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.798
I was betting on your headstone reading,
"Couldn't catch the Winchester boys."

06:20.965 --> 06:22.633
Well, they'll be at Supermax by morning.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.219
- How?
- Armored bus loaded with men.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.596
A bus.
What, are you trying to give me an ulcer?

06:27.763 --> 06:30.123
- Look, we're taking every precaution.
- Like the last time?

06:30.224 --> 06:33.394
And the time before that?
Screw that, I'm sending a chopper.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.229
Whatever you think is best.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.772
Damn right, and I'll be on it.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.066
Can't take you losing those boys again.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.777
They have been a primary
thorn in my ass for months.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.028
- So, Victor?
- Yeah?

06:43.195 --> 06:44.989
Glue your eyeballs
to them till I get there.

06:47.992 --> 06:50.995
- There's a chopper on its way.
- But we don't have a helicopter pad.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.664
Then clear the damn parking lot.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.679
You know what I'm trying to decide?

07:08.846 --> 07:11.765
I don't know, whether Cialis
will help you with your little condition?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.184
What to have for dinner tonight.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.186
Steak or lobster?

07:16.854 --> 07:19.523
What the hell. Surf and turf.

07:19.690 --> 07:23.986
I got a lot to celebrate. I mean,
after all, seeing you two in chains?

07:24.403 --> 07:27.197
You Kinky son of a bitch.
We don't swing that way.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.866
Now, that's funny.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.994
I wouldn't bust out the melted butter
just yet.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.330
Couldn't catch us at the bank.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.707
Couldn't keep us in that jail.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.295
You're right. Screwed up.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.548
I underestimated you.
I didn't count on you being that smart.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.175
But now I'm ready.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.594
- Ready to lose us again?
- Ready like a court order...

07:48.761 --> 07:51.347
...to keep you in a super-maximum prison
in Nevada till trial.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.558
Ready like isolation in a soundproof,
windowless cell so small...

07:54.725 --> 07:57.895
...that between you and me,
probably unconstitutional.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.648
How's that for ready?

08:04.526 --> 08:05.861
Take a good look at Sam.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.739
You two will never see each other again.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.368
Aw. Where's that smug smile, Dean?

08:12.910 --> 08:14.745
I wanna see it.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.249
- You got the wrong guys.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.919
You fight monsters.

08:22.086 --> 08:25.839
Sorry, Dean. Truth is your daddy
brainwashed you with all that devil talk...

08:26.006 --> 08:27.925
...and no doubt touched you
in a bad place.

08:28.092 --> 08:31.428
- That's all. That's reality.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.931
But guess what?
Life sucks, get a helmet.

08:34.098 --> 08:35.849
Because everybody's got a sob story.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.935
But not everybody becomes a killer.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.402
And now I have two less...

08:46.568 --> 08:48.278
...to worry about.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.576
It's surf-and-turf time.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.466
Steven.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.343
Gentlemen.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.639
- What's all this?
- What can I say?

09:15.806 --> 09:18.934
The FBI didn't invent bureaucracy,
we perfected it.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.312
- You want me to do all this now?
- Sorry. Now, Victor.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.358
I'm gonna go take a good long gander
at our fugitives.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.007
Sam and Dean Winchester.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.760
I'm Deputy Director Steven Groves.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.012
This is a pleasure.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.431
Glad one of us feels that way.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.642
I've been waiting a long time for you two
to come out of the woodwork.

10:26.084 --> 10:29.379
Sorry, I've gotta cut this short.
It's gonna be a long night, fellas.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.597
What the hell was that?

10:41.892 --> 10:43.227
- Put the gun down.
- Wait.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.854
- He shot him.
- I didn't shoot him. I didn't shoot anyone.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.023
- He shot me.
- Get on your knees now.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.818
Okay, okay. Okay, don't shoot, please.
Look, here. Here.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.736
Okay. Okay.

10:53.445 --> 10:57.366
We didn't shoot him. Check the body.
There's no blood. We did not kill him.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.077
Go ahead. Check him.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.584
- Vic, there's no bullet wound.
- He's probably been dead for months.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.586
- What did you do?
- We didn't do anything.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.339
- Talk or I shoot.
- You won't believe us.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.592
He was possessed.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.386
Possessed. Right.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.764
- Fire up the chopper, we're taking them out.
- Yeah, do that.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.724
Bill.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.937
Bill, you there?

12:08.312 --> 12:10.480
They're dead. I think they're all dead.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.318
What the hell was that? Reidy?

12:15.652 --> 12:17.362
Reidy?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.908
What is going on out there?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.243
Reidy, what the hell was that? Come in.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.914
Talk to me.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.582
Come in.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.792
Talk to me, Reidy.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.012
- Hello?
- My men. Agent Henriksen?

12:42.179 --> 12:44.598
- What's happening?
- I can't get a line. The phones are out.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.434
Henriksen! Four of my men.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.854
The Internet, I... My cell. It's all dead.
How can it all be dead?

13:03.617 --> 13:04.993
Oh, that can't be good.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.454
- Oh, my God.
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.289
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go right now.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.749
- Let's go.
- Nobody's going.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.710
- Everybody calm down.
- Your partner is out there. My men are...

13:13.877 --> 13:16.588
I know. We go out there,
we're asking to die too.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.006
- Don't you get it?
- What?

13:18.173 --> 13:21.093
They're out there and they're
coming in here. This is a siege.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.388
So this might be a good time for you
to lock the doors and the windows...

13:24.554 --> 13:27.015
...take a breath,
and deal with this like professionals...

13:27.182 --> 13:29.434
...with some sense in their heads.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.740
You okay?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.035
I wouldn't think so.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.162
Nancy, right?

13:49.329 --> 13:53.208
I'm gonna get you through this,
you got my word. You got that?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.131
All right, don't be such a wuss.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.133
What's the plan?

14:01.550 --> 14:03.802
Kill everyone in the station
and bust you two out?

14:03.969 --> 14:07.848
- What are you talking about?
- About your psycho friends, a bloodbath.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.766
Okay, I promise you:

14:09.933 --> 14:13.395
- Whoever's out there is not here to help us.
- Look, you gotta believe us.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.897
- Everyone here is in terrible danger.
- You think?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.025
Why don't you let us out
so we can save you?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.609
From what?

14:20.694 --> 14:25.240
You gonna say "demons"?
Don't you dare say "demons."

14:26.700 --> 14:30.579
Let me tell you something.
You should be a lot more scared of me.

14:34.666 --> 14:35.709
How's the shoulder?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.796
It's awesome.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.175
I'll live.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.761
You know, if we get out of here alive.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.138
So you got a plan?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.061
Hey.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.438
Hey. Hey, uh...

14:56.813 --> 14:58.732
Please. Please, we need your help.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.984
It's Nancy? Nancy, right?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.070
Nancy, my brother's been shot.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.529
He's bleeding really bad.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.490
Do you think you could get us a towel?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.867
Please, just one clean towel?

15:10.827 --> 15:13.413
Look. Look at us.
We're not the bad guys. I swear.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.712
Nice try.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.180
Thank you.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.852
It's okay.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.234
Thank you.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.868
Thanks.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.999
Let her go! Let her go!

15:58.166 --> 16:00.210
Okay.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.045
Freak.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.755
You okay, Nance?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.342
Try something again, get shot.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.178
- And not in the arm.
- Okay.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.561
What the hell was that?

16:28.196 --> 16:29.948
We're like sitting ducks in here.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.408
Yeah, I know.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.994
Would it kill these cops
to bring us a snack?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.788
- How many you figure are out there?
- I don't know.

16:36.955 --> 16:40.083
However many, they could be possessing
anyone. Anyone could just walk in.

16:40.584 --> 16:41.877
It's kind of wild, right?

16:43.044 --> 16:45.172
It means, like,
they're coming right for us.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.590
Never done that before.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.720
It's like we got a contract on us.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.890
You think it's because
we're so awesome?

16:55.056 --> 16:57.058
I think it's because we're so awesome.

17:02.272 --> 17:05.192
Well, howdy there, sheriff. Aah.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.450
- Uh, sheriff?
- It's time to go, boys.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.163
Uh, you know what?

17:18.330 --> 17:20.582
We're just comfy right here,
but thank you.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.126
What do you think you're doing?

17:23.293 --> 17:25.879
I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die.
We're gonna run for it.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.798
- It's safer here.
- There's a SWAT facility in Boulder.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.676
- We're not going anywhere.
- The hell we're not.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.105
Stay back.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.991
- Sam, hurry up.
- It's too late.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.452
I already called them.
They're already coming.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.439
Is he...? Is he dead?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.529
Henriksen. Hey.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.406
Is that you in there?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.545
I shot the sheriff.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.882
But you didn't shoot the deputy.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.016
Five minutes ago I was fine and then...

19:01.433 --> 19:04.477
Let me guess.
Some nasty black smoke...

19:04.644 --> 19:06.146
...Jammed itself down your throat?

19:08.565 --> 19:10.525
You were possessed.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.487
Possessed, like possessed.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.656
That's what it feels like. Now you know.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.118
I owe you the biggest I-told-you-so ever.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.299
Officer Amici.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.093
Keys.

19:43.725 --> 19:44.976
All right.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.604
So how do we survive?

20:05.955 --> 20:07.624
That's nice. It's not gonna do much good.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.751
We got an arsenal here.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.754
You don't poke a bear with a BB gun.
It's just gonna make him mad.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.965
- What do you need?
- Salt. Lots and lots of salt.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.801
- Salt?
- Is there an echo in here?

20:19.135 --> 20:21.596
There's road salt in the storeroom.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.223
Perfect. Perfect.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.975
We need salt at every window
and every door.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.983
How you holding up, Nancy?

20:34.192 --> 20:35.777
Okay.

20:37.320 --> 20:42.450
When I was little, I would come home
from church and talk about the devil.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.911
My parents would tell me
to stop being so literal.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.749
I guess I showed them, huh?

20:51.835 --> 20:53.169
That should hold.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.547
- Thank you.
- Sure.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.219
Hey, where's my car?

21:01.636 --> 21:02.929
- Impound lot out back.
- Okay.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.556
Wait.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.016
You're not going out there?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.103
Yeah, I gotta get something
out of my trunk.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.599
They're coming!

22:33.978 --> 22:35.313
Hurry!

23:26.531 --> 23:28.658
- Everybody okay?
- Define "okay."

23:29.701 --> 23:31.327
Right, everybody needs to put these on.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.247
It'll keep you from being possessed.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.624
Here you go.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.545
What about you and Sam?

23:43.798 --> 23:44.966
Smart.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.426
How long have you had those?

23:46.593 --> 23:47.677
Not long enough.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.363
Hey, that's Jenna Rubner.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.702
That's not Jenna anymore.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.288
That's where all that
black demon smoke went?

24:15.455 --> 24:16.748
Looks like.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.565
Shotgun shells full of salt.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.779
- Whatever works.
- Fighting off monsters with condiments.

24:49.864 --> 24:52.408
So turns out demons are real.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.913
FYI, ghosts are real too.

24:57.538 --> 25:00.083
So are werewolves, vampires...

25:00.249 --> 25:03.169
...changelings,
evil clowns that eat people.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.339
Okay, then.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.966
If it makes you feel better,
Bigfoot's a hoax.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.427
It doesn't.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.972
How many demons?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.641
Total?

25:16.849 --> 25:19.102
No clue. A lot.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.772
You know what my job is?

25:25.149 --> 25:27.944
You mean,
besides locking up the good guys?

25:28.111 --> 25:30.029
No, I have no idea.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.781
My job is boring.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.449
It's frustrating.

25:33.616 --> 25:36.035
You work three years for one break...

25:36.202 --> 25:39.455
...and then maybe you can save
a few people. Maybe.

25:40.623 --> 25:41.916
That's the payoff.

25:42.083 --> 25:45.294
Been busting my ass for 15 years
to nail a handful of guys...

25:45.461 --> 25:48.631
...and all this while, there was something
off in the corner so big.

25:49.298 --> 25:53.511
So, yeah, sign me up for that big
frosty mug of wasting my damn life.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.638
You didn't know.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.473
Well, now I do.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.980
What's out there?

26:04.147 --> 26:05.815
Can you guys beat it?

26:05.982 --> 26:07.859
Can you win?

26:09.861 --> 26:12.864
Honestly, I think the world's
gonna end bloody.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.534
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't fight.

26:16.784 --> 26:17.994
We do have choices.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.872
I choose to go down swinging.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.336
Plus, you got nothing to go home to
but your brother.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.505
Yeah.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.884
What about you,
you rocking the white-picket fence?

26:33.050 --> 26:37.513
Uh-uh. No. Empty apartment,
string of angry ex-wives.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.682
I'm right where you are.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.686
Imagine that.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.526
- How do we kill her?
- We don't.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.361
- She's a demon.
- She's here to help us.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.155
Are you kidding?

26:59.452 --> 27:01.370
Are you gonna let me out?

27:08.920 --> 27:10.713
And they say chivalry's dead.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.926
Anyone have a breath mint?
Some guts splattered in my mouth...

27:15.092 --> 27:17.470
...while I was killing my way in here.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.525
How many are out there?

27:30.691 --> 27:33.569
Thirty at least. That's so far.

27:33.736 --> 27:36.656
Oh, good. Thirty.
Thirty hit men all gunning for us.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.908
Who sent them?

27:40.409 --> 27:41.619
You didn't tell Dean?

27:42.411 --> 27:44.997
- Wow. I'm surprised.
- Tell me what?

27:45.164 --> 27:48.960
There's a big new up-and-comer.
A real pied piper.

27:49.126 --> 27:51.170
- Who is he?
- Not he.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.922
Her.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.007
- Her name is Lilith.
- Lilith?

27:55.174 --> 27:58.636
And she really, really wants
Sam's intestines on a stick.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.430
Guess she sees him as competition.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.641
You knew about this?

28:05.601 --> 28:07.812
Well, jeez, Sam.
Is there anything else I should know?

28:09.272 --> 28:11.607
How about the two of you
talk about this later?

28:11.774 --> 28:13.109
We'll need the Colt.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.366
Where's the Colt?

28:22.618 --> 28:25.329
- It got stolen.
- I'm sorry, I must have blood in my ear.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.874
I heard you say you were stupid enough...

28:28.040 --> 28:32.295
...to let the Colt get grabbed out
of your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.381
Fantastic.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.217
This is just peachy.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.136
- Ruby...
- Shut up.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.600
Fine.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.896
Since I don't see
that there's any other option...

28:50.062 --> 28:53.399
...there's one other way I know
how to get you out of here alive.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.693
- What's that?
- I know a spell.

28:56.319 --> 28:57.862
It'll vaporize every demon...

28:58.029 --> 28:59.822
...iln a one-mile radius.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.407
Myself included.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.203
So you let the Colt out of your sight
and now I have to die.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.749
So next time, be more careful.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.168
How's that for a dying wish?

29:16.714 --> 29:18.341
Okay. What do we need to do?

29:18.507 --> 29:21.177
Aw. You can't do anything.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.179
This spell is very specific.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.931
It calls for a person of virtue.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.768
I got virtue.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.853
Nice try. You're not a virgin.

29:33.731 --> 29:34.941
Nobody's a virgin.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.871
No. No way.

29:49.038 --> 29:52.541
- You're kidding me. You're...
- What? It's a choice, okay?

29:53.250 --> 29:54.627
What, so you...? You never...?

29:56.045 --> 29:58.714
Not even once? I mean, not even...?

29:59.715 --> 30:00.758
Wow.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.720
So the spell.

30:05.388 --> 30:06.430
What can I do?

30:06.597 --> 30:08.724
You can hold still...

30:09.809 --> 30:11.978
- ...while I cut your heart out of your chest.
- What?

30:12.144 --> 30:14.064
- What, are you crazy?
- I'm offering a solution.

30:14.230 --> 30:15.606
You're offering to kill somebody.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.025
What do you think's gonna happen
when the demons get in?

30:18.192 --> 30:20.236
- We're gonna protect her.
- Very noble.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.071
- Excuse me?
- You're all gonna die.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.573
- This is the only way.
- Yeah, there's no way...

30:24.740 --> 30:27.284
- ...that you're gonna prove...
- Everybody please shut up.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.246
All the people out there...

30:30.413 --> 30:31.497
...will it save them?

30:31.914 --> 30:34.417
It'll blow the demons out of their bodies.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.753
So if their bodies are okay, yeah.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.179
- I'll do it.
- No. No. You don't need to do this.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.514
All my friends are out there.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.934
We don't sacrifice people.
We do that, we're no better than them.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.272
We don't have a choice.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.607
- Well, your choice is not a choice.
- Sam.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.609
You know I'm right.

31:04.905 --> 31:05.948
Sam?

31:07.616 --> 31:10.202
What the hell is going on? Sam, tell her.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.288
It's my decision.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.291
- Damn straight, cherry pie.
- Stop.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.793
Stop.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.129
Nobody kill any virgins.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.633
Sam, I need to talk to you.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.849
Please tell me you're not considering this.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.684
Talking about cutting out her heart.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.270
We're also talking
about 30 people out there, Dean.

31:36.437 --> 31:37.480
Innocent people...

31:37.646 --> 31:40.149
...who are all gonna die,
along with everyone in here.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.903
It doesn't mean that we throw away
the rule book and stop acting like humans.

31:44.361 --> 31:47.490
I'm not gonna let that demon
kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl...

31:47.656 --> 31:49.742
...who hasn't even been laid.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.994
If that's how you win wars,
I don't wanna win.

31:52.161 --> 31:54.580
Then what? What do we do, Dean?

32:00.669 --> 32:01.712
I got a plan.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.548
I'm not saying it's a good one,
not saying that it'll work...

32:04.715 --> 32:06.342
...but it sure beats killing a virgin.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.177
Okay, so, what's the plan?

32:08.344 --> 32:11.180
Open the doors. Let them all in.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.516
And we fight.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.526
- Get the equipment to work?
- Yeah.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.820
- So?
- So this is insane.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.530
You win understatement of the year.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.991
- I get it. You think...
- I don't think. I know.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.409
It's not gonna work.

32:34.495 --> 32:36.205
So long, boys.

32:36.372 --> 32:38.874
- So you're just gonna leave?
- Hey.

32:39.542 --> 32:42.419
I was gonna kill myself to help you win.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.880
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you lose.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.386
And I'm disappointed.

32:50.553 --> 32:51.929
Because I tried.

32:52.096 --> 32:54.181
I really did.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.184
But clearly, I bet on the wrong horse.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.108
Do you mind letting me out?

33:20.708 --> 33:22.543
I'm leaving.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.588
Who wants to stop me?

33:43.731 --> 33:44.815
All set?

33:44.982 --> 33:47.109
- Yeah.
- Ready.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.278
Let's do this.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.628
I hope this works.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.436
Go, go, go!

35:24.707 --> 35:28.544
When this is over,
I'm gonna have so much sex.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.880
But not with you.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.924
We better move.

36:40.324 --> 36:42.618
Henriksen, now!

38:38.400 --> 38:39.568
I better call in.

38:39.735 --> 38:41.445
Hell of a story I won't be telling.

38:41.612 --> 38:42.946
So, what are you gonna tell them?

38:43.489 --> 38:46.450
The least ridiculous lie I can come up with
in the next five minutes.

38:46.617 --> 38:49.369
Good luck with that.
Not to pressure you or anything...

38:49.536 --> 38:52.176
- ...but what're you planning to do about us?
- I'm gonna kill you.

38:53.790 --> 38:57.211
Sam and Dean Winchester
were in the chopper when it caught on fire.

38:57.377 --> 39:00.714
Nothing's left. Can't even identify them
with dental records.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.384
Rest in peace, guys.

39:15.646 --> 39:17.105
Now get out of here.

39:17.731 --> 39:18.899
Yeah.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.167
Oh, hey, there.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.588
Excuse me, I'm looking for two boys.
They're brothers.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.299
One's really tall and one's really cute?

39:45.676 --> 39:47.135
What's your name, sweetie?

39:48.679 --> 39:50.389
Lilith.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.290
Turn on the news.

40:20.335 --> 40:24.423
The community is still reeling from the
tragedy that happened just a few hours ago.

40:24.590 --> 40:28.594
Authorities believe a gas main ruptured,
causing the massive explosion...

40:28.760 --> 40:33.515
...that ripped apart the police station
and claimed the lives of everyone inside.

40:33.682 --> 40:36.518
Among the deceased,
at least six police officers and staff...

40:36.685 --> 40:39.771
...Including Sheriff Melvin Dodd,
Deputy Phil Amici...

40:39.938 --> 40:41.440
...secretary Nancy Fitzgerald...

40:41.607 --> 40:45.027
...as well as three FBI agents
identified as Steven Groves...

40:45.193 --> 40:47.237
...Calvin Reidy and Victor Henriksen.

40:47.404 --> 40:50.115
Two fugitives in custody
were also killed.

40:50.282 --> 40:54.453
We'll continue to follow the story here at
the scene, but for now, back to you, Jim.

41:02.377 --> 41:05.881
- Must've happened right after we left.
- Considering the size of the blast...

41:08.216 --> 41:10.510
...smart money's on Lilith.

41:10.761 --> 41:13.055
- What's in these?
- Something that'll protect you.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.391
Throw Lilith off your trail.
For the time being, at least.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.226
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.979
Lilith killed everyone.

41:21.730 --> 41:26.109
She slaughtered your precious little virgin
plus a half a dozen other people.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.237
So after your big speech
about humanity and war...

41:29.404 --> 41:32.240
...turns out your plan
was the one with the body count.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.370
Do you know how to fight a battle?

41:36.536 --> 41:38.747
You strike fast
and you don't leave any survivors...

41:38.914 --> 41:41.249
...so no One can go running
to tell the boss.

41:41.416 --> 41:44.753
So next time, we go with my plan.
