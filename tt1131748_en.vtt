WEBVTT

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:19.546
Are you ready?

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:23.863
Didn't think I'd be
this nervous...

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:30.936
Now or never.

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:38.124
Alright, papi, let's do this.

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:41.498
He's over there.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.546
You must be Michael.

00:00:54.217 --> 00:00:56.467
Your friend, Fernando, tells me
you can use my services today.

00:00:57.268 --> 00:00:58.268
Very much so.

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:01.018
And I assume... thats the
other half of your team?

00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:11.514
You look beautiful.

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:14.983
Thank you.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.721
And it's my understanding
you'd like to keep this simple?

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.881
We've never actually manage
to keep anything simple...

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:27.719
You can try.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.347
Well.
Let's begin then, shall we?

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:33.959
Family and friends,
we gather here...

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.842
To celebrate the union between
Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi.

00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:25.467
- Sorry to break up the party.
- What the hell's going on?

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.590
We have an arrest warrant.

00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:28.139
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.640
We've talked to Agent
Paul Kellerman in D.C,

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:31.841
we've settle this with the feds.

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:33.741
We settle this with
the feds weeks ago!

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:34.542
Sir, back up!

00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:36.271
- We were exonerated.
- Sir...

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:37.872
- We were exonerated!
- Back up!

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:40.673
We're not here for you.
We're here for her.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.309
She didn't do anything.
She wasn't involved.

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:45.717
Don't make this escalate!

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.325
Sara Tancredi,

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:49.826
you're under arrest for the
murder of Christina Hampton.

00:02:49.994 --> 00:02:51.905
What?
She didn't kill anyone!

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.949
Funny. Surveillance camera
footage says different.

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:58.027
Michael.

00:02:59.386 --> 00:03:02.310
- Please, right this way.
- Michael. Michael!

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.580
- The Final Break -

00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:13.581
Edited By:
.: thesurferguy :.

00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:17.233
They'll not gonna
let me see her.

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:19.904
Why did Kellerman send you
if you can't do anything?

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:23.074
They're trying to break both of you.

00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:26.394
Look, she has constitutional
right to reasonable visitation.

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:29.079
I'll draw up an order to show cause
and get it before the judge immediately.

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:30.069
What do you argue in?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.470
- Do you argue in self defence?
- How?

00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:35.184
Anything that might
help her is out of frame.

00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:38.645
Security camera only shows Sara
stepping up and firing at the victim.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.755
- Pull the trigger, Michael.
- Drop... the gun!

00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:44.592
Misfire.

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:50.081
- She worked for the Company.
- To you.

00:03:50.637 --> 00:03:53.083
To a jury, she's Christina Hampton,
Technology Consultant.

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:54.878
And because she was so good
at hiding her true identity,

00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:55.948
we can't prove otherwise.

00:03:57.742 --> 00:04:00.825
Look, you all get exonerated
did not set well with law enforcement.

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:03.150
If they can make Sara
pay for it, they will.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.065
How much time
is she looking at?

00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:08.498
25 to life.

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:27.349
You.
Over here.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.625
You.
Here.

00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:36.380
You.
Here.

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:41.991
This one's yours.

00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:46.421
- Am I supposed to be in a different facility?
- I don't think so.

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:50.092
I haven't been convicted of anything yet.
I'm supposed to be in a jail. This is prison.

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.898
Overcrowding and budget cuts, fish.

00:04:52.623 --> 00:04:55.376
This is the jail.
That's the prison.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.346
Was'sup homey?
You need some help?

00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:13.032
You've got everything
you need over there?

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:14.633
Why don't you go help
and make her bed?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.098
Don't let them spook you.
They just like to intimidate.

00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:27.248
They are good at it.

00:05:28.092 --> 00:05:29.092
Look.

00:05:29.092 --> 00:05:32.220
This jail-prison hybrid thing's B.S.

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.190
Come on.
The other one's practically empty.

00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:37.991
You can ride it out to
your court date there.

00:05:40.498 --> 00:05:41.499
Thank you.

00:05:59.294 --> 00:06:02.489
Here. This should be a little
bit more comfortable for you.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.290
Okay.

00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:11.343
What's going on?

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:13.712
You know...

00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:17.177
At first, I couldn't place your name.

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.454
Tancredi.
It sounded so familiar.

00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:23.103
But then, Haggs here, figure it out.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.812
I remember your pretty
face from the papers.

00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:32.507
You are not going anywhere, fish.
This is going to happen.

00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:35.898
Half a dozen guards lost their jobs
and pensions at Fox River.

00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:38.655
Another dozen were put on probation,
after you decided

00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:42.180
to leave the door open for your boyfriend
and his seven convict pals.

00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:45.663
And we... ain't gonna let anything
like that happen again.

00:06:50.624 --> 00:06:52.785
Don't worry, we won't
hit the baby basket.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.176
Looked like that welcome wagon
ran over your face.

00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:16.432
It looks that way, huh?

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:23.343
Alright, well...

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.867
If you need something,
you just ask for me.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.350
Everybody calls me "Daddy".

00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:55.096
Special delivery.

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:01.705
You know, all we need is a little cash,
spread around in places.

00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:05.027
I told you. The government's
exposing my assets.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.658
You tellin' me you can't get
your hands on the cash?

00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:11.508
Unless, that's the least you can do.

00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:13.705
Considering you're gonna
kill me not too long ago.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.736
Goodbye, Theodore.

00:08:19.703 --> 00:08:21.526
You ain't never been
incarcerated before,

00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:24.027
and I never been
incarcerated here. Therefore,

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:26.154
Now let's just say
this handicapped connie

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.255
got the juicy hand back
in Fox River.

00:08:30.422 --> 00:08:34.487
Your pathetic existence here
can be ameliorated.

00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:36.687
As can my life, all with

00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:38.734
a little "Roberto De Niro".

00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:41.987
One of our friends has been
apprehended by the authorities.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.706
Looks like we've got
a new neighbour.

00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:51.149
I'm never gonna get out of
this prison alive. I know that.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.453
I wanna bring my enemy down with me.

00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:56.454
I want her...
Dead.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.432
Either way, it's going to
require a capital.

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:08.516
A capital you no longer have.

00:09:08.657 --> 00:09:11.376
My rainy day plan.
You know where it is.

00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:14.862
Jonathan. I'd assume that
that would be use for your defense.

00:09:14.985 --> 00:09:16.657
It's good money at the bad, Joe.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.754
They're not gonna
let me out of here.

00:09:19.655 --> 00:09:21.355
No matter how many shots that I have.

00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:27.900
Get that. To our friend, in the
sister cells, across the compound.

00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:12.659
Excuse me.

00:10:15.658 --> 00:10:16.659
Bad move.

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:21.974
Last time someone touched her,
they got a crack kneecap.

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.260
You're much braver than
I gave you credit for.

00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:46.767
Either that,
or you're amazingly nice.

00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:48.068
Do I look like
I wanna talk to you?

00:10:49.018 --> 00:10:52.260
I just say, a woman in your position
laid up for some protection.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.817
Join the prison gang?
I don't think so.

00:10:55.144 --> 00:10:56.407
Not a gang.
No.

00:10:57.608 --> 00:10:58.308
A family.

00:11:00.503 --> 00:11:01.743
They don't call her "Daddy"
for nothin'.

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:05.642
That's her wife.

00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:08.243
And those are her kids.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.712
- Are you okay?
- Stay the hell away from me.

00:11:18.862 --> 00:11:20.068
I need the infirmary.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.143
Can't go down to the infirmiary
without the release form.

00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:25.259
I'm having muscle contractions on my throat.
And my jaws tightening up.

00:11:25.347 --> 00:11:27.941
It's just--It's just could be indigestions,
I'm not poisoned.

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:30.180
No. That's government cheese.
You'll get used to it.

00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:32.255
If I don't get to the hospital
in the next 15 minutes,

00:11:32.973 --> 00:11:35.350
I will die and my baby will die.
Please.

00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:37.803
Boss.

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.741
Why don't you let her
go see the doc?

00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:46.254
Please.

00:11:47.972 --> 00:11:50.509
This is Kaorla. We have an
inmate going into the infirmary.

00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:01.107
We were able to administer
the charcoal ???

00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:02.904
You and your baby
are gonna be okay.

00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:08.667
You know the ??? didn't get into
my meatloaf all by itself, right?

00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:10.820
Well then, you need to talk
to the warden about it.

00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:15.982
Then how about talking
to me about your face?

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:17.819
You want to tell me
how that happened?

00:12:20.301 --> 00:12:21.950
I caught an elbow
playing basketball.

00:12:24.737 --> 00:12:27.069
We should discuss your...
situation.

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:30.819
As I'm sure you've ascertain this isn't
going to be a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:32.858
Can I deliver in here?

00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:35.459
No. The day we're induced,
we'll secure you in an ambulance.

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:38.176
We'll take you to St. Lucia
down the road.

00:12:38.816 --> 00:12:39.579
We'll cordone off a room.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.180
There'll be 3 armed guards
in there with me,

00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:41.981
when you give birth.

00:12:42.504 --> 00:12:43.903
Do I get to see my baby?

00:12:44.942 --> 00:12:46.512
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.184
I've seen this process a dozen times.

00:12:52.974 --> 00:12:55.943
After the mothers come back here,
the depression's almost unbearable.

00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:57.022
My advice,

00:12:57.974 --> 00:13:01.102
it's a lot less messy, if you'd just
think of yourself as a surrogate.

00:13:12.973 --> 00:13:13.974
Yeah?

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:15.823
Michael, this Lou Phillips.

00:13:16.973 --> 00:13:18.622
Your wife had an incident earlier today.

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:20.819
Someone tried to poison her.

00:13:21.816 --> 00:13:22.817
What are you talking about?

00:13:23.066 --> 00:13:24.299
Michael, I need you to focus.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.900
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:27.896
Michael?

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:29.708
Michael?!

00:13:31.426 --> 00:13:32.427
Go ahead, let him in.

00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:46.744
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me,

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:49.288
Your name will be at the bottom,
somewhere below

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:51.789
Jesus Christ and Scooby Doo.

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:55.354
- Someone tried to poison Sara today.
- Mercy--

00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:58.027
Only you
would be depraved enough,

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:01.235
to think that killing an innocent woman
and an unborn child

00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:04.179
will bring you some kind of peace
before your execution.

00:14:04.786 --> 00:14:06.617
Sara is with child?

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:08.863
Congratulations!

00:14:09.564 --> 00:14:12.464
This is like the 4th of July and
Christmas day rolled into one.

00:14:12.537 --> 00:14:13.626
I am asking you,

00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:16.827
father to father,
to leave her alone.

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:19.793
You can kill me
if you want to kill me,

00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:21.263
I'll trade my life for hers.

00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:23.461
But leave Sara alone.

00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:24.944
Michael,

00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:27.528
If you were killed,

00:14:28.729 --> 00:14:30.029
your pain will last a moment.

00:14:30.615 --> 00:14:31.909
If Sara were killed,

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.110
your pain will last
the rest of your life.

00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:38.898
Now that's got to be appealing
to whoever who put out this hit.

00:14:39.786 --> 00:14:41.075
But don't worry, Michael.

00:14:41.976 --> 00:14:44.076
If I find out anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

00:14:47.537 --> 00:14:48.663
Prison life can be tough.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.101
If I remember correctly,

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:52.305
you have two missing toes
that can attest to that bag.

00:14:52.381 --> 00:14:55.157
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

00:14:56.382 --> 00:14:56.916
Please.

00:14:58.517 --> 00:15:00.717
Please just approve the
transfer to another facility.

00:15:00.818 --> 00:15:02.979
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody's gonna want one.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.387
What about segregrated housing?

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.232
Is there something
that I should know about

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.233
the structural integrity of shoe?

00:15:09.728 --> 00:15:10.714
I can see where this is going.

00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:11.867
I know who you are.

00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:14.718
And I'm not going to let you turn
my prison into the next Fox River.

00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:17.868
All I'm trying to do,
is keep my wife alive.

00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:19.752
You do know she's pregnant.

00:15:20.616 --> 00:15:21.719
I don't care.

00:15:36.788 --> 00:15:37.789
Here.

00:15:38.663 --> 00:15:40.540
- Thanks.
-In case I haven't made myself clear--

00:15:40.616 --> 00:15:43.540
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:48.230
And you've made yourself perfectly clear.
Thank you for your time.

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:55.745
- What happened?
- The General wants Sara dead--

00:15:55.943 --> 00:15:57.513
And the warden's just
gonna let that happen.

00:15:57.818 --> 00:15:59.900
We gotta lure in her case and
needs to get her out, right?

00:15:59.976 --> 00:16:00.779
Which is not enough time.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.980
If she stays in that prison,
someone's going to kill her.

00:16:04.507 --> 00:16:05.508
I guess we don't have a choice.

00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:10.821
We're breaking her out.

00:16:20.788 --> 00:16:22.630
In my 16 years in the Bureau,

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:25.431
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

00:16:27.023 --> 00:16:28.249
Alexander Mahone,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.550
is the smartest,

00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:31.951
bravest,

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:35.869
most honorable man, I've ever
had the pleasure of serving with.

00:16:37.586 --> 00:16:41.545
As one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended.

00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:45.541
Because obviously, I am not as honoured
as this drive addicted murderer.

00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:49.232
Alex has been clean and
sober for four months.

00:16:49.663 --> 00:16:51.986
And he's been completely
exonerated of all crimes

00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:53.987
associated with his
involvement with the Company.

00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:57.311
That doesn't include the shooting
and the murder of one Oscar Shales

00:16:57.508 --> 00:17:00.591
- and burying his body under his bird bath--
- That is just an allegation--

00:17:01.898 --> 00:17:02.738
Let's move on, shall we?

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:05.539
All those in favor of
reinstating Alexander Mahone,

00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:08.610
a Special Agent in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation--

00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:10.411
Aye.

00:17:13.382 --> 00:17:15.668
- All those oppose?
- Alright, alright, I've--

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.984
Thank you for the invite, Richard.

00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:27.306
It's always a pleasure.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:32.345
You know, Alex.
This ruling can't be revisited.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.167
If you're able to
sufficiently demonstrate,

00:17:35.168 --> 00:17:37.868
just how committed you
are to a life of service.

00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:42.077
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently,

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.540
and is currently being house at
the Miami Dade State Penitentiary.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.721
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:53.828
So this-- this is why
you're invite me in here.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.871
Well obviously, if Scofield were, to be able to
pull off this plot of another breakout,

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:02.982
the public embarassment will
be immensed to the Bureau.

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:06.094
So... having someone to get
us a credible information,

00:18:06.595 --> 00:18:08.395
that would be worth something to us.

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:11.260
Agent Whitley is set up in Miami.
He will be your contact.

00:18:11.587 --> 00:18:12.793
You're something else.

00:18:22.032 --> 00:18:23.032
Now...

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:24.798
We both know...

00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:26.899
How badly you want
that badge back.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.950
Give me a reason to give it to you.

00:18:31.818 --> 00:18:34.514
What's your plan after we break her out?
We're on the run again?

00:18:34.663 --> 00:18:36.585
First thing first.
Let's get her out of there.

00:18:36.663 --> 00:18:37.742
Hey papi.

00:18:37.843 --> 00:18:40.543
The fed that arrested Sara,
is outside, staking us out.

00:18:42.869 --> 00:18:45.428
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:47.029
go back to Chicago,
go back to your family.

00:18:47.712 --> 00:18:48.713
I'll understand.

00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:49.980
Are you kidding me?

00:18:50.104 --> 00:18:51.820
After all the crap we've been through,
I'm just going to leave you here

00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:52.721
and Sara in there?

00:18:53.182 --> 00:18:54.956
You shut up and
don't bring it up again.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.876
- What's all that?
- Newspaper clippings--

00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:02.230
Covering 7 different escape attempts
from Miami Dade's State Pen--

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.779
over the last 60 years.
None of them--

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.880
None of them successful.

00:19:06.588 --> 00:19:09.034
So we weigh them all,
and we learn what not to do.

00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:10.469
Well the prison officials learned a lot,

00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:12.190
They re-evaluated,
they retrofitted,

00:19:12.712 --> 00:19:14.464
The prison's pratically escape-proof.

00:19:15.307 --> 00:19:16.831
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine--

00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:20.910
I guess so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

00:19:21.307 --> 00:19:23.654
Like down into the prison?
We--we parachute in.

00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:24.755
Yeah.

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:27.436
- Yeah. You parachute in, we find her--
- Are you kidding?

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.034
- I'm serious--
- That's suicide!

00:19:30.463 --> 00:19:32.442
Newspapers clippings only
going to get us so far.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.387
We need some more
information about the prison.

00:19:34.588 --> 00:19:35.988
So let's do some recon work.

00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:40.074
Camera, electronic tape measure,
dry ice. What's this?

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.620
It's a shopping list.

00:19:47.182 --> 00:19:48.240
You need to come with me, doc.

00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:50.986
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy in a few minutes.

00:19:50.987 --> 00:19:51.387
It'll wait.

00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:54.542
In here.

00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:57.512
Hold it.

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:08.542
I don't know what you want,

00:20:08.619 --> 00:20:10.234
but I promise you,
I won't go down and fight it.

00:20:11.073 --> 00:20:12.722
Damn baby, I ain't gonna hurt you.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.033
Hell, I ain't even gonna touch you.

00:20:21.105 --> 00:20:23.471
See, I run the motor
pool detail in here.

00:20:23.948 --> 00:20:26.621
And I was thinkin' if you want to
get yourself a little fresh air,

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.156
and not have to worry about
getting stab in the back,

00:20:29.745 --> 00:20:32.077
then you could come in,
work with me...

00:21:26.309 --> 00:21:27.515
You're the fed from my wedding.

00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:29.237
Yeah, you can call me Agent Whitley.

00:21:29.308 --> 00:21:30.673
I could call you a lot of things.

00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:31.876
- Where are you headed?
- Sea World.

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:33.732
Sea World?
There isn't one in Miami.

00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:36.033
- My loss.
- No. What really be your loss,

00:21:36.152 --> 00:21:38.519
is getting your wife killed,
by doing something stupid.

00:21:38.793 --> 00:21:41.318
- Are you threatening Sara?
- No, no. Not at all--

00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:43.871
I'm just saying that if you gonna try
and revoke her sentence.

00:21:43.872 --> 00:21:45.472
Bullets fly, Michael.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.546
And if she'd get hurt,
that'll be on you.

00:21:47.793 --> 00:21:50.546
Funny hearing that from the guy who
put her in prison in the first place.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.032
No, I didn't put her in prison.
State of Florida did.

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.878
It's just my job to make sure
that she stays there.

00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:57.687
So ah...

00:21:58.388 --> 00:21:59.388
where's all your little buddies?

00:22:05.607 --> 00:22:07.187
Alright. Drop in some more dry ice.

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:26.242
Fence line is 4 feet...
from the road.

00:22:32.732 --> 00:22:36.395
And 32 feet...
from the east camera.

00:22:36.794 --> 00:22:39.957
- Hurry up. They're gonna see the laser.
- I'm going as fast as I can, papi--

00:22:44.794 --> 00:22:46.955
- He followed you?
- Yeah, but he's gone now--

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:48.670
You guys almost done?

00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:53.747
- Almost.
- Great. I'll meet you back at the loft--

00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:14.902
Well, you're just a natural.

00:23:17.177 --> 00:23:18.792
I bet you are a hell of a surgeon.

00:23:21.172 --> 00:23:23.970
Handing out condoms to cons
were makin' you no damn surgeon!

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.254
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

00:23:25.327 --> 00:23:28.228
- You ain't even ask me if she can come...
- One day, for real!

00:23:28.501 --> 00:23:30.662
Can we go one day without
your mouth? One!

00:23:35.094 --> 00:23:36.095
Let it be today.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.453
I'm sorry. You've got to
forgive my old lady, she's--

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.711
You just a little bit
easy on eyes, you know?

00:23:50.112 --> 00:23:51.612
She's just the jealous type.

00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:54.100
Crazy is the type she's more like it.

00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:57.476
What? You're gonna
watch your tone, Agatha.

00:23:57.477 --> 00:23:58.377
Sorry--

00:23:58.685 --> 00:24:01.734
- Or you want me take off my belt?
- Sorry--

00:24:05.968 --> 00:24:06.969
Kids.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.532
It's rough.
It's hard running a family.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.432
It's important though that, uh--
That you have one--

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:20.433
I have a family.
I have a husband.

00:24:20.655 --> 00:24:22.941
Oh, you've got a husband?
Is he here?

00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:26.323
They let you bring it in here,
with you, when you came?

00:24:27.624 --> 00:24:28.524
No.

00:24:29.577 --> 00:24:30.896
Yeah, I had a husband too.

00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:35.971
18 years is a long time to wait.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.787
So, you know.
If this ain't for you,

00:24:43.088 --> 00:24:43.988
that's cool.

00:24:48.218 --> 00:24:50.136
Then you pick up that nasty oil,

00:24:50.437 --> 00:24:52.337
take it out and put it
in the repository.

00:24:53.238 --> 00:24:54.138
Okay.

00:25:17.172 --> 00:25:18.173
We gotta go, bro.

00:25:25.094 --> 00:25:27.176
- Take your hands off me.
- When I'm good and ready.

00:25:28.531 --> 00:25:30.101
What's Burrows doing at the fence?

00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:41.383
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

00:25:53.608 --> 00:25:57.328
Nobody here that'll help you but yourself.
Are you going to answer me?

00:25:58.218 --> 00:25:59.219
You tried to kill me.

00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:02.382
Line it up, cons.
Go back inside.

00:26:02.609 --> 00:26:05.510
You, get back to your detail.
Now!

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.252
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

00:26:27.938 --> 00:26:31.146
What he's paying his people to
dust that Tancredi chicken bitch pop,

00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:33.891
my woman are good for a cut rate.

00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:38.335
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:39.790
Tell him uh--

00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:43.591
if he's offering a 100 grand,
my girl will take 30.

00:26:44.423 --> 00:26:46.744
No, 40. 40.

00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:49.095
Perfect.

00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:51.298
I'll tell him.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.861
Hey, five stars.

00:27:01.609 --> 00:27:05.739
So you have no cash,
whatsoever...

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.502
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over
the sound of that broken record.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.376
Got it.
I won't ask again.

00:27:33.096 --> 00:27:34.516
Oh, to what do we
owe the honor?

00:27:35.517 --> 00:27:36.817
I've been thinking...

00:27:37.454 --> 00:27:40.821
Well, no need to be uh, shy.
Just spit it out.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.611
I've change my mind.

00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:45.894
No, well maybe Daddy
change her mind.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.054
Maybe she don't want you
here no more.

00:27:49.579 --> 00:27:54.380
Sports right. I recently rolled up
my welcome mat. Peace.

00:28:01.658 --> 00:28:03.660
- Please.
- Please, what?

00:28:06.611 --> 00:28:08.260
Please, may I be a part
of your family?

00:28:12.174 --> 00:28:13.175
Take a walk.

00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:15.612
Take a walk!

00:28:21.894 --> 00:28:24.067
I would love that. I would--
Sit down. I really would.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.949
You see, its not that easy.
It's just saying "I do".

00:28:33.564 --> 00:28:36.862
See, in order to make a commitment...
to a family,

00:28:45.503 --> 00:28:47.232
It's something you gotta prove.

00:28:48.221 --> 00:28:49.506
That's right, we all did it.

00:28:58.581 --> 00:29:01.152
It's a commitment...
to the family code.

00:29:04.502 --> 00:29:05.867
It's a code you gotta wear.

00:29:26.253 --> 00:29:27.254
Alex!

00:29:28.504 --> 00:29:31.257
- What's up?
- How are you doing, man?

00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:32.660
What's going on?

00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:34.816
We gotta talk.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.301
Alright.

00:29:37.737 --> 00:29:38.738
They're watching you.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.825
- We know. We gotta a fed on us.
- No. Not just one.

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:43.582
The whole department.

00:29:43.737 --> 00:29:46.183
Sounds a lot like inside
information, Alex.

00:29:46.582 --> 00:29:48.436
What you do?
Make a deal with the feds?

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.378
They offered me my old job back,
if I came down here to spy on you.

00:29:54.504 --> 00:29:56.601
Now the fed you're talking about,
his name is Whitley.

00:29:56.902 --> 00:29:57.702
He's running point.

00:29:58.051 --> 00:29:59.052
So now we know.

00:29:59.145 --> 00:30:00.579
So if you really gonna do this,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.380
you gotta do it right.

00:30:04.176 --> 00:30:05.382
And I'll help you
if you need me.

00:30:08.972 --> 00:30:09.973
What else do you get?

00:30:10.504 --> 00:30:12.699
Sara's working the motor pool
today at 4 o'clock.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.503
Motor pool is here.

00:30:14.504 --> 00:30:17.904
This hold by two security cameras,
along the perimeter of the prison.

00:30:17.972 --> 00:30:22.147
- What about secondary entrances?
- No loading dock, no personnel entrance--

00:30:22.223 --> 00:30:22.870
Fences?

00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:25.671
15 feet high,
covered with rave wires.

00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:27.514
- Electrified?
- No. Why?

00:30:27.973 --> 00:30:29.747
If Sara can get herself
back to motor pool,

00:30:30.863 --> 00:30:32.262
I think we can find
a way inside.

00:30:32.895 --> 00:30:35.558
With all the different retrofits over
the years, the fence line is widened.

00:30:35.676 --> 00:30:38.622
But security cameras remain
exactly where they've always been.

00:30:39.224 --> 00:30:40.543
They've never accounted for the difference.

00:30:40.863 --> 00:30:43.946
- There's a blindspot.
- Yeah. Right here --

00:30:44.224 --> 00:30:46.340
If Sara can get back to that spot,
we can breach the fence.

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:47.506
It's risky, Michael.

00:30:48.504 --> 00:30:49.505
That's all we've got.

00:30:49.896 --> 00:30:51.693
How much time to tell Sara
where we going to meet her?

00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:54.380
How? We've got no visitations,
no phone calls.

00:31:02.224 --> 00:31:04.590
It's clean.
Take it to Tancredi.

00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:27.309
Remember when I taught
you about flowers?

00:31:27.896 --> 00:31:29.102
I wish I was with you now.

00:31:29.864 --> 00:31:31.513
To see you holding one
in your hand.

00:31:37.536 --> 00:31:39.185
To see you holding one
in your hand.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.592
Tomorrow. PM.
Seven. Oil dump.

00:32:17.615 --> 00:32:20.539
- Sure looks like you've been busy.
- Do you have a warrant, Agent Whitley?

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.590
A warrant?
No, I don't need one.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.788
My testimony will be
your brother let me in.

00:32:24.864 --> 00:32:29.233
Once inside, saw all this evidence,
right in plain sight.

00:32:29.506 --> 00:32:31.539
What judge gonna take
your word over mine?

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.640
What evidence?

00:32:32.975 --> 00:32:34.670
Those pictures were taken
from public property.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.459
That prison, was paid for
by the taxpayers.

00:32:37.614 --> 00:32:38.884
So all you have evidence of,

00:32:38.885 --> 00:32:41.585
is an exonerated citizen,
standing on a public road,

00:32:41.662 --> 00:32:43.186
taking pictures of a public building.

00:32:43.459 --> 00:32:45.620
Last I checked,
it's not a crime.

00:32:46.148 --> 00:32:48.027
What if I said that I
could get you on attempt,

00:32:48.428 --> 00:32:50.028
just for having all these stuff?

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.261
What if I told you that all this
was peace offering?

00:32:53.256 --> 00:32:54.666
The warden won't let me see my wife.

00:32:55.428 --> 00:32:57.749
So I figured, if I found a
few lapse in the security,

00:32:58.053 --> 00:32:59.873
pointed them out as a
gesture of good faith,

00:33:00.412 --> 00:33:01.538
she might change her mind?

00:33:01.818 --> 00:33:04.184
Is that so?
Find anything yet?

00:33:04.662 --> 00:33:06.459
No.
Looks airtight.

00:33:08.334 --> 00:33:09.528
Well thank goodness for that.

00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:12.829
You guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?

00:33:13.148 --> 00:33:14.308
You'll be the first to know.

00:33:31.866 --> 00:33:33.948
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done.

00:33:34.226 --> 00:33:35.227
No matter what.

00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:36.903
I got paid well for it.

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:40.385
Now I'm broke.
But I still need things.

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:43.067
- Like what?
- A favor.

00:33:43.568 --> 00:33:45.268
I don't do favors for cons.

00:33:45.694 --> 00:33:48.265
Really? It's not what it
says on the bathroom walls.

00:33:49.023 --> 00:33:52.789
As I understand, you'd do favors
for those who reciprocate.

00:33:57.585 --> 00:33:58.586
Is that true?

00:34:06.663 --> 00:34:10.235
This is bullshit, Boss!
I'm a veteran around here.

00:34:12.945 --> 00:34:14.424
Ain't no reason to toss me!

00:34:17.226 --> 00:34:18.227
You low leaf!

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.260
Looky, looky here.

00:34:23.335 --> 00:34:25.826
No! That brown ain't mine, boss.
You know this!

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.059
I do no drugs!

00:34:27.695 --> 00:34:28.821
Who put that in here?!

00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:33.587
You ugh--! Take your hands off me.
I know where the hold is.

00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:35.587
What y'all looking at?

00:34:36.024 --> 00:34:39.391
I do no drugs!
Somebody is going down there!

00:34:39.664 --> 00:34:40.665
I love you too.

00:34:42.508 --> 00:34:44.590
Sofia's making arrangements
in Central America.

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:46.821
Once we break Sara,
we're on the boat, we're gone.

00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:50.712
- Hey.
- It's Lou.

00:34:50.713 --> 00:34:52.113
Just got a decision from the court.

00:34:52.305 --> 00:34:54.671
They're ordering the warden
to allow supervised visitations.

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.344
- Where are you going?
- They're letting me Sara.

00:34:59.345 --> 00:35:00.745
Pera, pera, pera, pera--

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.623
If you going to be listening to every word
you say, you gotta be careful about this.

00:35:04.696 --> 00:35:06.698
If she understood my letters,
she'll find a way to tell me.

00:35:08.103 --> 00:35:10.105
How? She's going to blink
the Morse code?

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.181
Oh my God!

00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:39.305
Oh my God!
Who did this to you?

00:35:39.383 --> 00:35:41.419
I'm okay.
Baby's okay.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.870
Sara, I'm so sorry.
You're in here because of me.

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.625
I'm sorry.
This is hard.

00:35:53.946 --> 00:35:55.982
- I miss you so much
- No touching--

00:35:59.384 --> 00:36:00.385
I miss you too.

00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:04.597
You just have to
hang in there, okay?

00:36:06.384 --> 00:36:08.955
I'm trying.
But my protection's gone.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.596
- Did you get my letter?
- I did.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.229
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I want to say.

00:36:19.228 --> 00:36:22.718
But I hope you understood...
what I meant to tell you.

00:36:23.819 --> 00:36:25.019
I did.

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:28.949
Isn't he cute?

00:36:30.152 --> 00:36:33.622
You were there for me.
And I will be there for you.

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.386
- Okay.
- Alright, that's it.

00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:39.948
Time's up.

00:36:41.979 --> 00:36:43.037
See you soon.

00:36:49.744 --> 00:36:50.745
Bye.

00:37:10.151 --> 00:37:11.152
Michael.

00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:16.393
I was thinking a lot.

00:37:16.394 --> 00:37:19.194
About the photos and the mock-up
that you showed me at the loft.

00:37:19.542 --> 00:37:20.986
And I ran a few tests.

00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:23.427
Lo and behold,
I've found a blindspot.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.676
Right along the fence line over here,
due to our retrofit.

00:37:27.417 --> 00:37:31.421
You didn't know about this, did you?
No, no of course not.

00:37:31.511 --> 00:37:34.184
Because you would've told me or the warden
about it if you did, right?

00:37:34.902 --> 00:37:38.417
Well, it's a good thing I found this when
I did, in case anyone tries to escape.

00:37:52.227 --> 00:37:55.105
Well if we can't go through the fence,
then that leaves under or over.

00:37:55.364 --> 00:37:58.258
Look, how she gonna climb that
fence without being seen? Huh?

00:37:58.335 --> 00:38:01.156
I'm guessing there's no telephone
wire for her to climb across.

00:38:01.227 --> 00:38:04.230
- Then she's gotta go under.
- Alright, lets get some shovels--

00:38:04.698 --> 00:38:06.594
What was that you were
saying about parachutes?

00:38:06.595 --> 00:38:07.395
Parachutes--

00:38:08.183 --> 00:38:11.391
Guys, come on.
You can be ser-- Parachutes?

00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:13.386
Couple of thoughts on that.
A - We don't have a plane,

00:38:13.387 --> 00:38:14.387
B - We don't have a pilot.

00:38:15.464 --> 00:38:18.831
- Have you ever worn a parachute?
- Don't worry, I think I've got a plan.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.988
But we're gonna need some
help from an old friend.

00:38:22.789 --> 00:38:23.689
Who?

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.313
- You want a favor from me.
- Just hear me out.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.172
Of course. I mean,

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:31.473
when you and Michael send
me back to that prison,

00:38:31.474 --> 00:38:33.674
you did give me
a piece of chewing gum.

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:36.521
I mean what kind of man will I be
if I don't quit your pro-quote?

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:37.522
Look,

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:40.109
All you gotta do is sound off
the fire alarm, in here

00:38:40.183 --> 00:38:41.878
Tomorrow night
at 7:30.

00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:44.512
That's it.

00:38:44.871 --> 00:38:47.908
- You're breaking her out.
- Krantz has put a hit on her,

00:38:48.777 --> 00:38:50.243
that's a one shot,

00:38:51.444 --> 00:38:53.144
of keeping her alive.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.824
Well you're on a pivoted
kind of damn, Lincoln.

00:38:56.028 --> 00:38:58.826
We'll put 5 grand on your cake
once this whole thing jumps off.

00:38:59.543 --> 00:39:02.831
The love of Michael's life
is only worth of $ 5,000?

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.106
That's the best we can do.

00:39:05.058 --> 00:39:06.980
- I need six figures.
- That's all we got--

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:12.345
Alackaday for you, I know somebody
who does... the general's man.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.241
He's got the payout for Sara's hit.

00:39:17.746 --> 00:39:22.592
You wire that money to me by 7pm
tomorrow, and we're in business.

00:39:22.949 --> 00:39:23.700
What is his name?

00:39:23.701 --> 00:39:25.601
It's your brother to you
that agony is.

00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:29.316
- Come on, you gotta give me more than that.
- Tomorrow. 7pm. Go on, fetch.

00:39:42.543 --> 00:39:44.192
You should have seen the
look on Michael's face.

00:39:44.262 --> 00:39:46.753
When he saw me fixing that fence
and installing that camera.

00:39:48.699 --> 00:39:49.700
You did a great job.

00:39:51.591 --> 00:39:52.751
Job's over now.

00:39:53.778 --> 00:39:57.748
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger,

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.903
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.883
Your job will be over until
you give us enough evidence

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.315
to put him back behind bars.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.110
So what's the latest?

00:40:08.904 --> 00:40:09.853
There's nothing concrete.

00:40:10.554 --> 00:40:11.954
But I'll let you know
when I get something.

00:40:12.698 --> 00:40:14.984
Alright.
Good man.

00:40:40.591 --> 00:40:41.706
Tough going alone.

00:40:42.388 --> 00:40:45.039
I know he's breaking you out.
I'm coming with you.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.821
Relax.
Krantz sent me to kill you,

00:40:53.888 --> 00:40:56.674
but after what he's put me through,
I'm done taking orders from him.

00:40:56.747 --> 00:40:58.601
You're sitting next to me at
the mess when I was poisoned.

00:40:58.904 --> 00:41:00.986
You'd think you would've lasted
this long if I wanted you dead?

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.520
I want you dead.
You're still alive.

00:41:03.592 --> 00:41:05.753
Don't you think it's hard to stay alive
when you know who's coming after you?

00:41:06.232 --> 00:41:11.033
There's 200 women in this prison.
Bet do you even get to Gen Pop?

00:41:16.232 --> 00:41:17.895
I'm coming with you.

00:41:18.196 --> 00:41:19.396
Or nobody's going.

00:41:48.622 --> 00:41:51.621
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.

00:41:52.122 --> 00:41:53.822
Because that means you're safe.

00:42:02.514 --> 00:42:05.392
- How does he think he's gonna do this, bro?
- He's going to jump out of the plane.

00:42:05.468 --> 00:42:07.345
I know he's gonna jump.
The question is, can he land?

00:42:07.827 --> 00:42:08.885
Not without getting caught.

00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.350
And how is he going to get
out of cell block, even if T-Bag--

00:42:11.624 --> 00:42:14.627
It's a big "if".
Trusting T-Bag is... crazy.

00:42:16.234 --> 00:42:19.219
Michael, we uh--
we really have to re-think this.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.320
I have.
And there's no other way.

00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:23.599
Okay.

00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:25.990
I'm going to drop down
into this outer area here.

00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:28.594
And I cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

00:42:28.827 --> 00:42:29.987
They're going to be
right on your ass.

00:42:30.234 --> 00:42:32.316
I can hide behind this building,
wait for a window.

00:42:32.622 --> 00:42:33.828
Then I'll make my way over here.

00:42:34.464 --> 00:42:37.921
That's the chapel. Well hopefully uh--
Sara will be waiting.

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:38.822
Why the chapel?

00:42:38.896 --> 00:42:42.127
During the riot in '88, prison employees
escaped through the administration building.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.696
They wound up here,
outside the fence.

00:42:44.861 --> 00:42:47.773
The administration building,
is connected to the chapel.

00:42:47.894 --> 00:42:49.912
Which means that
somewhere in that compound,

00:42:50.313 --> 00:42:51.513
there is a subterranean exit.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.583
If we can get through it,

00:42:54.584 --> 00:42:55.584
you can meet us there.

00:42:55.737 --> 00:42:58.979
- How's Sara gonna get to the chapel?
- She'll have to find a way.

00:43:00.032 --> 00:43:02.659
Look, we're doing this at 7pm tonight,
just like we've planned.

00:43:03.016 --> 00:43:04.688
- Where have you been?
- What did I missed?

00:43:05.124 --> 00:43:07.172
I need you to find a plane
and a pilot.

00:43:07.766 --> 00:43:09.415
And you two,
to take care of T-Bag.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:12.658
Find out exactly who has this money,
and where they're keeping it.

00:43:13.047 --> 00:43:15.584
- And then we have to get it.
- By 7pm tonight.

00:43:18.968 --> 00:43:20.253
Or Sara's going to die in there.

00:43:21.609 --> 00:43:22.689
Is everybody onboard?

00:43:24.578 --> 00:43:25.579
Okay.

00:43:29.609 --> 00:43:31.179
Tell me, you've completed
your assignment.

00:43:32.937 --> 00:43:36.020
Well, I got the cash. But there'll
may be some delay in final delivery.

00:43:36.406 --> 00:43:39.375
The woman we hired is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

00:43:39.454 --> 00:43:41.740
Then hire somebody else.
Call it open season.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.896
Put a bounty on her head.
I don't care how you do it.

00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:47.097
I want Sara Tancredi
dead by the end of the day.

00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:51.861
Open cells!
One hour!

00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:03.773
We're about to play cards,
do you want in?

00:44:05.892 --> 00:44:07.052
I'm okay.
Thanks.

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:08.580
You should.

00:44:09.407 --> 00:44:11.455
With Daddy gone,
you're gonna need your backup.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.252
Hell, we all did.

00:44:17.376 --> 00:44:21.038
- I've got uh-- a pre-natal thing.
- It's cool.

00:44:21.039 --> 00:44:21.939
Thanks.

00:44:22.298 --> 00:44:24.300
Not too smart though, for a
girl with a bounty on her head.

00:44:27.502 --> 00:44:28.503
Aren't you heard?

00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:32.777
Tancredi, you have a visitor.

00:44:35.938 --> 00:44:37.462
Say hello to your husband for me.

00:44:49.893 --> 00:44:50.894
What's wrong?

00:44:53.292 --> 00:44:54.292
Look, um...

00:44:55.736 --> 00:44:58.660
I know you don't have any control
over what's happened here, but uh--

00:45:01.018 --> 00:45:02.133
Things aren't working out.

00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:05.503
Okay.

00:45:06.252 --> 00:45:10.871
I'm trying to find a way to--
To do... this.

00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:15.225
But from where we're standing
right now, there's only one option.

00:45:16.454 --> 00:45:18.121
Do you need more time...
to think?

00:45:19.322 --> 00:45:21.222
No. No, it's not
about that.

00:45:21.938 --> 00:45:26.102
I've made up my mind. Cause there's
nothing you could do about it.

00:45:27.455 --> 00:45:30.583
Except...
pray for us tonight.

00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:32.737
Pray for us?

00:45:33.736 --> 00:45:35.180
You can pray for us
to be together.

00:45:36.736 --> 00:45:37.771
Maybe I'll do the same.

00:45:42.611 --> 00:45:45.262
How can I rob someone if
I've no clue who he is?

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:49.213
The logbook outside says that
Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

00:45:49.514 --> 00:45:50.614
A Joe Daniels.

00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:54.943
Well if he was in the power deduction,
I'd say, Daniels is your bagman.

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:57.896
You know how many Daniels live Miami?
Thousands. I need more.

00:45:57.971 --> 00:46:01.611
Well you better get crackin', cause
if I ain't get that money by 7 o'clock,

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.022
you ain't got your fire,
you ain't got your fire alarm.

00:46:04.222 --> 00:46:06.099
And that means Pretty
ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

00:46:06.175 --> 00:46:08.970
Listen my friend, you're in
no position to makin' demands--

00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:09.971
Okay, shh--

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:13.904
I ain't talking about
backing out the deal.

00:46:13.905 --> 00:46:16.105
I put my ear on the ground
and come up with some details.

00:46:16.378 --> 00:46:17.379
Good.

00:46:18.612 --> 00:46:19.613
And now, fetch.

00:46:27.254 --> 00:46:28.255
We've got a pilot.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.746
There's a guy I'd busted 20 years ago,
running drugs across the Gulf.

00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:34.104
Went legit.
Went to charter business now.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.029
He must've jumped
out of a few planes, huh?

00:46:36.222 --> 00:46:39.589
Yes, several. Some for sport.
Some necessity.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:40.896
It's a big difference, Michael.

00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:44.692
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

00:46:44.769 --> 00:46:47.101
Don't worry.
I can go alone.

00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:50.457
- What do you got?
- It's a test.

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:53.058
See, the prison was built
in the mid-80's,

00:46:53.736 --> 00:46:55.059
so that exit in the
administration building

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.060
is probably protected
by an electronic code of lock,

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.024
modified by a security card.

00:47:00.769 --> 00:47:04.182
Those locks don't have power protection,
which means you can overwrite them.

00:47:04.972 --> 00:47:07.268
Then you can't just go to the building,
shut it and blow it out?

00:47:07.269 --> 00:47:08.169
No.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.054
1200 volt power surge will
just set off the other alarms.

00:47:12.862 --> 00:47:14.261
Not to mention
that it'll kill you.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.894
- So we have to find another way.
- Yeah--

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:37.401
Yeah.

00:47:37.402 --> 00:47:38.902
Talk to me, Mahone.
What have you got?

00:47:39.332 --> 00:47:41.744
- Nothing yet.
- I don't need updates on the hour.

00:47:41.816 --> 00:47:43.977
I need evidence, intent.
It's not crap.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.121
Call me when he's in the
process of committing a crime.

00:47:46.122 --> 00:47:46.622
Yeah.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.942
I'm not going to let him walk
away from me like he did from you.

00:47:49.176 --> 00:47:51.098
It's going down if I've
got to shoot him in the back.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.021
Sorry.

00:49:10.584 --> 00:49:11.585
Are we friends now?

00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:13.898
Get out of the way!
What happened here?!

00:49:13.974 --> 00:49:14.975
I didn't see anything, sir.

00:49:15.536 --> 00:49:16.582
Move!

00:49:27.896 --> 00:49:28.942
Bad news.

00:49:30.489 --> 00:49:32.741
Agatha Warren is dead.

00:49:40.052 --> 00:49:42.589
- Who did that?
- No one's talking.

00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:47.333
But I hear it says fish.
Tancredi and Morgan.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.381
No!

00:49:51.303 --> 00:49:52.747
No!

00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:55.132
There he is.

00:49:55.256 --> 00:49:58.180
If you don't like this guy,
we can still find someone else.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.461
Good to see you, Sni.

00:50:01.584 --> 00:50:03.188
What you get into here, Mahone?

00:50:03.693 --> 00:50:05.945
Jumping off 1500 feet
ain't going to be easy.

00:50:06.178 --> 00:50:07.444
You've gone back
on your word already?

00:50:07.445 --> 00:50:09.345
Let's not forget who's
doing who a favor here.

00:50:09.346 --> 00:50:10.346
Favor?

00:50:10.459 --> 00:50:13.337
Favor that I bust your old lady
for traficking. No, I did not.

00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:18.107
If anyone asks,
I was flying tourists to the Keys,

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.384
- And it's not my fault they jumped.
- Sounds good to me.

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:31.029
If you don't like this guy,
we'd take a day

00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:33.702
- We come up with a new plan.
- No, there's no time, Alex.

00:50:35.178 --> 00:50:38.022
-It's not just Sara's life at risk.
- I understand that.

00:50:39.132 --> 00:50:42.101
I know you do. That's why I also
know I can ask for your help.

00:50:44.257 --> 00:50:46.418
- Yeah. What do you need?
- If I don't make it--

00:50:47.382 --> 00:50:50.101
I want you to make sure Sara and
my brother get out of the country alive.

00:50:50.585 --> 00:50:52.029
I need to know
they're gonna be okay.

00:50:53.538 --> 00:50:56.314
And I'm gonna trust that you'll do
everything you can to make that happen.

00:51:01.944 --> 00:51:02.945
Take this.

00:51:09.944 --> 00:51:11.104
I trust you, Alex.

00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:14.492
Remember that.

00:51:44.945 --> 00:51:45.980
Special delivery.

00:51:46.492 --> 00:51:48.869
- What is it?
- I don't exactly know.

00:51:48.944 --> 00:51:51.424
It came via messenger from uh--
the lady side.

00:51:52.055 --> 00:51:56.059
"My man on the outside needs to know
who to call for the birthday present."

00:51:56.133 --> 00:51:57.304
Who's birthday is it?

00:52:06.024 --> 00:52:07.597
Well see to it that it gets back
to the same place.

00:52:07.598 --> 00:52:08.698
Will do.

00:52:13.492 --> 00:52:15.983
So this is Joe Daniels number, right?

00:52:16.102 --> 00:52:18.878
Is that enough information or you need
a social security number too?

00:52:19.024 --> 00:52:20.264
- That'll do.
- Remember--

00:52:20.664 --> 00:52:23.189
I want that money wired to
the account number specified.

00:52:23.258 --> 00:52:24.464
No wire, no fire.

00:52:24.867 --> 00:52:25.809
You boys do me wrong,

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.110
I have no qualms at all about singing
it loud and clear, you understand?

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.386
You know what?
Just be ready.

00:52:30.102 --> 00:52:33.469
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:34.133 --> 00:52:35.179
That was Sofia.

00:52:35.336 --> 00:52:37.902
She'll meet you at San Andreas harbor
in Dominican Republic and then

00:52:37.974 --> 00:52:39.822
- you guys can fly to Costa Rica.
- Cool.

00:52:40.382 --> 00:52:41.383
I know where Daniels is.

00:52:41.616 --> 00:52:44.448
And after we rob him, I'll take
the money to Quik Green and uh--

00:52:44.976 --> 00:52:45.977
wire to the bank.

00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:49.190
- You will meet us at the airstrip, right?
- Might give a shot now.

00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:50.191
Okay.
This is it.

00:52:51.899 --> 00:52:52.900
We're ready.

00:52:56.102 --> 00:52:57.103
Thanks, buddy.

00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:00.260
For everything.

00:53:01.336 --> 00:53:03.588
Good luck, papi.
See you on the other side.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.666
Nobody's talking, huh?
Girl's dead. No one's said any?

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:20.822
I made it in the workshop.

00:53:21.775 --> 00:53:25.313
Want to give to my daughter Emily
a birthday gift on her actual birthday.

00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:27.466
So I need to get out of here.

00:53:28.899 --> 00:53:32.744
- You're never sentimental.
- Oh, I'm not. It's just for her.

00:53:40.228 --> 00:53:41.468
We need to get to the chapel.

00:53:44.306 --> 00:53:45.269
We?

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.470
There's no way out of here right now.
I'm gonna need you.

00:54:03.879 --> 00:54:04.812
Yeah?

00:54:04.813 --> 00:54:07.313
Mr. Daniels, American Paint Company
here for the job.

00:54:08.166 --> 00:54:11.032
Well, this is Mr. Daniels but
I didn't order any painters.

00:54:14.136 --> 00:54:15.990
It's Wednesday, sir.
I believe you did.

00:54:16.385 --> 00:54:18.546
Hold it right there.
I'm calling the police.

00:54:34.307 --> 00:54:35.308
Get out!

00:54:41.182 --> 00:54:42.183
This is it.

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:45.824
I'll be right back.
Gotta get that parachute.

00:55:01.619 --> 00:55:02.620
Michael!

00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:05.542
Come here.

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.981
There's a better way.

00:55:14.058 --> 00:55:16.595
Mess!
Mess, half hour.

00:55:20.948 --> 00:55:22.597
Little faster.
We don't have all day.

00:55:24.744 --> 00:55:25.745
Let's go!

00:55:31.822 --> 00:55:32.823
Got any ideas?

00:55:33.182 --> 00:55:35.855
Yeah. Keep your head down and follow me.
I'll think of something.

00:55:41.384 --> 00:55:43.136
You better think of something fast,
'cause we have company.

00:56:05.058 --> 00:56:06.753
I hope you're ready
for a fight, princess.

00:56:07.182 --> 00:56:08.262
This one's to the death.

00:56:13.183 --> 00:56:14.593
Do you think you can overpower her?

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:22.623
Yeah. I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

00:56:25.383 --> 00:56:26.384
Just be ready.

00:56:35.542 --> 00:56:37.190
- Hello?
- It's me.

00:56:37.191 --> 00:56:39.991
I've got the message
about the birthday present?

00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:43.597
- Was the gift earned?
- What in the hell are you talking about?

00:56:43.903 --> 00:56:46.315
- The birthday present!
- Birthday present?

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:48.787
Two guys showed up at my house,
they took the money and they beat

00:56:48.788 --> 00:56:50.188
the crap out of me.

00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:02.030
Howdy, General.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.865
I just thought of let you know
how I came up with some green.

00:57:08.184 --> 00:57:12.473
My personal preference is two
Zegna bars and a copy of the Times.

00:57:13.622 --> 00:57:15.192
So I see you in the AM?

00:57:16.341 --> 00:57:19.469
You worthless son of a whore.
Go to hell!

00:57:19.779 --> 00:57:21.394
Careful I don't get there first.

00:57:22.419 --> 00:57:24.990
Unless I become the
king of that prison, too.

00:57:33.138 --> 00:57:35.789
Alright, from takeoff, the
prison's gonna come up real fast.

00:57:36.138 --> 00:57:38.387
So whatever you gotta do
to get ready, do it now.

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:40.188
You get it.

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:42.266
We've got the money.

00:57:43.067 --> 00:57:44.867
Sucre's just dropped me off
on the way to wire it.

00:57:45.106 --> 00:57:47.028
Good.
That means T-Bag's set.

00:57:47.778 --> 00:57:49.314
I'm goin' to see how long it's
gonna take and we get going.

00:57:52.981 --> 00:57:55.142
- You sure that thing's gonna hold you up?
- Yes, it'll be fine.

00:57:56.184 --> 00:57:57.185
What about you?

00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:58.856
This is not my first time
inside a prison.

00:58:00.668 --> 00:58:02.989
But hopefully...
Will be my last.

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:14.959
Think about all the amazing stories
that you're gonna tell your kid.

00:58:19.138 --> 00:58:21.265
You're gonna be the type
of father our dad never was.

00:58:22.388 --> 00:58:23.503
Someone to look up to.

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.118
Take care, Michael.

00:58:32.623 --> 00:58:34.248
Unless you've got details,
I'm hanging up.

00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:36.549
And you can forget about
getting your badge back.

00:58:36.623 --> 00:58:38.750
He's got a plane.
He's got a parachute into the yard.

00:58:38.826 --> 00:58:40.191
- What?
- I swear to God,

00:58:40.312 --> 00:58:42.428
he's gonna be over
prison airspace at 7 o'clock.

00:58:49.186 --> 00:58:51.950
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs in the yard.

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.827
And be ready to turn off
all exterior lights.

00:58:53.951 --> 00:58:56.033
Scofield won't see what's coming,
until it's too late.

00:58:57.185 --> 00:58:58.504
And bring me Sara Tancredi.

00:59:05.466 --> 00:59:06.467
Wait, wait.

00:59:07.216 --> 00:59:09.423
What do you think happened with
Agatha, it's not what happened.

00:59:09.592 --> 00:59:11.150
I need to make this
right with you, okay?

00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:12.851
Go ahead.

00:59:14.186 --> 00:59:15.471
I was hoping I'd see you here.

00:59:16.984 --> 00:59:19.430
You know I still owe you
one big juicy favor.

00:59:19.952 --> 00:59:21.192
Later, blue eyes.

00:59:21.264 --> 00:59:24.472
I swear to God she wanted to kill me
and I was just defending myself.

00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:27.187
- You remember that?
- Yes, I do.

00:59:27.623 --> 00:59:28.624
My momma gave me that.

00:59:30.702 --> 00:59:32.829
Told me I was going to give it
to one of my kids one day.

00:59:34.312 --> 00:59:37.395
Not only did I get knocked up,
but the girl in the family...

00:59:38.951 --> 00:59:42.318
And I practically raised Agatha
and she was no killer.

00:59:43.984 --> 00:59:45.861
Now I can say
that much for myself.

00:59:48.186 --> 00:59:49.790
You didn't know
what I had in mind yet.

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.189
Okay, listen, you're right.
Agatha isn't a killer.

00:59:53.264 --> 00:59:56.779
She was just a-- real bitch with
a bit of more than she need to.

01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:01.859
Skittles.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:03.600
Okay.

01:00:03.692 --> 01:00:08.040
We cool. We cool.
We cool, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:09.623 --> 01:00:12.706
Kaorla. She'd want you to
bring Tancredi to her office.

01:00:14.062 --> 01:00:15.188
A'ight? Okay.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.751
Son of a bitch!

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.033
They coming right
through here, okay?

01:00:46.906 --> 01:00:49.682
Federal agent Todd Whitley.
I need to get inside right now.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.274
Emergency team takes priority, sir.

01:00:51.344 --> 01:00:53.596
I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside.

01:00:53.672 --> 01:00:56.709
- Sorry. Strict orders.
- Go talk to your supervisor. Come on!

01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:59.955
No weapons!
Let the suburban through.

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:10.831
The plane should be overhead
any minute.

01:01:12.219 --> 01:01:13.425
Hey, fellas!
Kill the lights.

01:01:23.548 --> 01:01:25.789
As soon as he hits the ground,
I want one of you to start firing.

01:01:31.032 --> 01:01:32.033
Standby.

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:38.595
We're standing by.

01:01:40.594 --> 01:01:42.118
Easy now.
Hold your fire.

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.111
Standby!

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.141
Now!

01:01:56.378 --> 01:01:57.902
Let's go.
Move in, men!

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:16.936
Where the hell's Scofield?

01:02:27.766 --> 01:02:29.302
Emergency team takes priority, sir.

01:02:29.376 --> 01:02:32.209
I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside right now.

01:02:32.298 --> 01:02:34.493
I've strict orders.
No one gets inside at this point, sir.

01:02:34.579 --> 01:02:36.456
I don't know what your orders are.
Go talk to your supervisor.

01:02:58.205 --> 01:03:00.025
Why isn't Tancredi
in front of me right now?

01:03:00.096 --> 01:03:03.304
We've just got the situation under control.
We're looking for her right now.

01:03:04.486 --> 01:03:05.487
Oh my God!

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:08.534
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. It was Morgan.

01:03:09.768 --> 01:03:11.542
Check the kitchen.
They might be in the kitchen.

01:03:47.175 --> 01:03:48.381
I'm not gonna make it on my own.

01:03:51.736 --> 01:03:54.182
Either leave me with tools here
or make up your damn mind.

01:04:12.847 --> 01:04:16.021
- Are you gonna be able to make it?
- Yeah.

01:04:16.456 --> 01:04:17.582
Okay.
It's now.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.301
Alright, hold up.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.661
Nah, I think we're good.

01:05:03.848 --> 01:05:04.849
Don't move!

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.282
- Stood on the dark, now!
- Please, I just ...

01:05:15.283 --> 01:05:17.183
On the ground!

01:05:25.614 --> 01:05:26.615
You're here alone?

01:05:28.332 --> 01:05:30.539
Damn it, con. When I ask
you a question, you answer.

01:05:30.613 --> 01:05:32.308
Is there anyone else here?

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.021
Yes.

01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:36.942
Who?

01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:41.975
- God.
- Excuse me?

01:05:43.332 --> 01:05:44.412
He's always here.

01:05:46.128 --> 01:05:48.130
I was worried about my little girl
on the outside.

01:05:49.175 --> 01:05:53.691
So I came to pray.
See if someone would watch over her.

01:05:59.129 --> 01:06:00.130
Go check it out.

01:06:21.536 --> 01:06:23.822
The stove mess is open.
Need support right now!

01:06:23.942 --> 01:06:25.466
I've got to get
these animals lockdown!

01:06:25.771 --> 01:06:26.772
We better head over there.

01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:34.716
I hope that daughter of yours

01:06:34.717 --> 01:06:37.617
- is hell a lot smarter than you.
- So do I.

01:06:56.537 --> 01:06:57.538
Are you ready to go?

01:07:04.022 --> 01:07:06.263
Nobody gets in or out of this prison.

01:07:06.334 --> 01:07:08.276
I don't care if it's the President
having to take a piss,

01:07:08.277 --> 01:07:09.577
you tell him to turn the hell around.

01:07:09.975 --> 01:07:10.976
Get a team.

01:07:11.053 --> 01:07:14.022
I want every inch of that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

01:07:14.178 --> 01:07:15.179
Yes, sir.

01:07:19.567 --> 01:07:21.262
Michael said this is where
they're gonna come out.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.948
You think Sucre make the drop on time?

01:07:27.302 --> 01:07:28.303
I don't know.

01:07:38.411 --> 01:07:39.696
No, no, no.

01:07:45.178 --> 01:07:47.032
Please enter your account number.

01:07:49.243 --> 01:07:51.185
9248. #

01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:57.265
Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.618
If you would like to
access another account--

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.064
9248. #

01:08:04.897 --> 01:08:09.140
Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.

01:08:10.663 --> 01:08:13.029
What the hell you thinking you're
doing, fish? We're in lockdown.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.909
What for?

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:16.210
Something's going on in
bitch block. I don't know.

01:08:17.662 --> 01:08:19.266
What's it worth to you
to find out?

01:08:26.459 --> 01:08:27.460
We're going to get through here?

01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:30.627
On the other side is a kind of an
escape patch for the administrators.

01:08:31.028 --> 01:08:32.028
In case of a riot.

01:08:32.382 --> 01:08:34.054
If this is the same system
they have in Fox River,

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:37.424
that door can only be open
remotely from the Centre Control.

01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:38.698
That's why we've gone
and ask for help.

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.383
T-Bag.

01:08:44.694 --> 01:08:45.820
Tell them what you told me.

01:08:47.102 --> 01:08:49.423
Michael Scofield is about
to stage a prison break.

01:08:51.538 --> 01:08:53.620
And I know exactly
how he's gonna do it.

01:08:56.694 --> 01:08:58.571
Exactly what did
Scofield asks you to do?

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.741
Just light a fire in my cell.

01:09:00.742 --> 01:09:03.542
And the rest...
the rest will just take care of itself.

01:09:04.616 --> 01:09:07.221
A fire alarm. If that goes off,
what's your protocol?

01:09:07.336 --> 01:09:08.860
State law, mandatory evac.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.674
Hell, he won't go break, I was
goin' to get you and escort her out.

01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:13.312
- Shut up!
- Get him outta here.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.822
Alright, the evacuation's only
going to get him out in the yard.

01:09:18.102 --> 01:09:21.310
Whatever he's up to, he needs noise
and he needs chaos.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.421
Deactivate the smoke detection system,
the fire alarm,

01:09:24.492 --> 01:09:25.777
and while you're at it,
kill the horn.

01:09:26.133 --> 01:09:28.947
If anybody so much as bends a
blade of grass in this place,

01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:30.548
I want him to be able to hear it.

01:09:37.852 --> 01:09:39.672
- Why are we waiting for?
- We made a deal.

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:43.931
With the right price,
T-Bag will set off the fire alarms.

01:09:55.383 --> 01:09:56.543
That's what we're waiting for.

01:10:09.774 --> 01:10:10.934
- Michael, there's a--
- It's okay.

01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:14.699
See, there's only one thing you can count on
when you're dealing with T-Bag.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:16.337
He's a rat.

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:20.625
Anything?

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:22.626
So far just a female inmate
loose in the yard.

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:24.857
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.465
- Over by the chapel.
- Alright.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.665
Alright.

01:10:40.134 --> 01:10:41.260
Great.
Let's go.

01:10:48.853 --> 01:10:50.389
Okay, down there.

01:11:06.421 --> 01:11:07.921
Okay.

01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:11.346
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

01:11:12.025 --> 01:11:13.310
On the other end of that, is Linc,

01:11:13.384 --> 01:11:14.109
and after that,

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:17.310
there's a boat mounted
for the white sands and blue water.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:24.336
A power surge to the system, will override
the reader, for just a few seconds.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:26.143
Just long enough for you
to open that, so get ready.

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:32.701
3, 2, 1.

01:11:36.696 --> 01:11:37.697
One more time.

01:11:39.134 --> 01:11:40.931
3, 2, 1.

01:11:48.854 --> 01:11:50.105
I was afraid this might happen.

01:11:50.744 --> 01:11:52.371
It's okay.
It's alright.

01:11:52.372 --> 01:11:54.272
We're going to keep moving and
we're gonna find another way out of here.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.037
I know what I have to do.

01:12:14.214 --> 01:12:17.468
I need units to the chapel.
Now!

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:28.532
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:29.833
They should've been here by now.

01:12:34.745 --> 01:12:36.667
The battery wasn't
generating enough power.

01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:38.933
We have to blow up the system
for the whole building.

01:12:43.746 --> 01:12:45.145
Okay.
What do you want to try?

01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:48.824
This is the main fuse.

01:12:48.902 --> 01:12:49.765
If I yanked that,

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:52.066
everything will go dark
for a second.

01:12:53.105 --> 01:12:54.629
I reconnect these two cables...

01:12:57.214 --> 01:12:58.624
If I reconnect these two cables,

01:12:59.136 --> 01:12:59.903
there'll be a lot of noise,

01:13:00.704 --> 01:13:02.504
every light bulb in this place
is going to blow.

01:13:02.574 --> 01:13:04.394
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:06.580
And I want you
to start running.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.114
Okay.
What about you?

01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:16.417
Michael?

01:13:17.855 --> 01:13:18.856
Sara...

01:13:20.902 --> 01:13:22.427
Someone has to stay here,

01:13:23.328 --> 01:13:24.828
and someone has to
open the hatch.

01:13:25.933 --> 01:13:27.343
And that someone's gotta be you.

01:13:27.746 --> 01:13:29.668
Okay. So I'll leave it
open for you.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:31.699
You don't understand.

01:13:32.698 --> 01:13:33.824
This is the only way.

01:13:40.105 --> 01:13:42.187
I'm not leaving unless
you're coming with me.

01:13:45.105 --> 01:13:46.265
But I am coming with you.

01:13:53.746 --> 01:13:54.747
I love you.

01:13:56.183 --> 01:13:57.423
God, I love you too.

01:14:03.059 --> 01:14:04.060
Go!

01:14:05.136 --> 01:14:07.218
Go, Sara.
Go.

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:11.419
Downstairs.

01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:31.264
Where's Michael?

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.551
Sara, where is he?
Where's Michael?

01:15:37.497 --> 01:15:38.498
Where is he?

01:15:52.934 --> 01:15:53.992
He's not coming back.

01:16:00.545 --> 01:16:01.546
He's not coming back.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.427
What do you mean, he's not coming back?
What do you mean by that?

01:16:08.904 --> 01:16:09.905
He's not coming back.

01:16:16.498 --> 01:16:17.499
He'll be here.

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:21.702
He's gone, Lincoln.

01:16:29.857 --> 01:16:30.858
Linc, we've gotta go.

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.061
We've gotta go.

01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.219
We've gotta go.

01:17:32.218 --> 01:17:36.507
Why am I being punished?!
I'm the guy through the window!

01:17:36.624 --> 01:17:38.785
You aided and abetted
an escape, Mr. Bagwell.

01:17:38.858 --> 01:17:41.634
And as far as the authorities are
concerned, you're an accomplice.

01:17:43.344 --> 01:17:44.629
Scofield!

01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:47.681
Scofield!

01:17:51.391 --> 01:17:54.588
Scofield!

01:18:17.188 --> 01:18:19.270
Michael asked me to give you this,
if he didn't make it out.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.548
He said it would help you understand
why he did what he did.

01:18:27.438 --> 01:18:28.996
It's his bloodwork.

01:18:52.672 --> 01:18:53.832
This is the General's money.

01:18:55.216 --> 01:18:58.549
I was supposed to wire it down to
Costa Rica for you to pick up but uh--

01:19:00.262 --> 01:19:01.422
I ran into some trouble.

01:19:03.544 --> 01:19:04.545
I'm sorry.

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.910
You take care of that baby, okay?

01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:11.398
You take care yours.

01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:40.111
This is for you.

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.300
He never said anything to me.

01:19:45.423 --> 01:19:46.469
Why didn't he just tell me?

01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:49.869
'Cause he knew you'll try
to stop him.

01:19:50.672 --> 01:19:52.401
He knew you do anything
to protect your family.

01:19:53.064 --> 01:19:54.065
But I didn't.

01:20:00.298 --> 01:20:01.798
Well...

01:20:03.033 --> 01:20:04.034
You will soon.

01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:08.910
Take it easy.

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:19.221
Sara.

01:20:21.548 --> 01:20:22.549
Thank you.

01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:26.190
Yeah.

01:21:05.534 --> 01:21:07.058
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.

01:21:08.052 --> 01:21:09.258
Because that means you're safe.

01:21:13.098 --> 01:21:14.292
And that's all I ever wanted.

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.746
I wish I could...
be there with you.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:21.902
But as you probably know now,

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.853
I wouldn't have much
time anyway, so--

01:21:27.456 --> 01:21:29.272
I've made my choice,
and--

01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:31.973
I don't regret it.

01:21:35.331 --> 01:21:37.379
Anyway,
not too long from now,

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.780
there's going to be another
Scofield running around.

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:41.794
And Linc,

01:21:42.595 --> 01:21:43.995
I want you to promise me,

01:21:44.396 --> 01:21:45.296
no matter what,

01:21:45.924 --> 01:21:48.336
they're going to grow up knowing
their uncle is never far away.

01:21:50.768 --> 01:21:51.577
And Sara,

01:21:52.478 --> 01:21:54.978
I want you to promise me that
you're gonna keep an eye on Linc.

01:21:56.096 --> 01:21:58.382
As you may have notice, he has
the tendency to get in trouble.

01:22:05.172 --> 01:22:06.969
You know we spend
so much of our lives,

01:22:08.016 --> 01:22:09.768
not saying the things
we want to say.

01:22:10.844 --> 01:22:12.175
The things we should say.

01:22:13.924 --> 01:22:16.244
We speak in codes,
we send little messages.

01:22:16.845 --> 01:22:18.045
Origami.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.103
So now, plainly,
simply,

01:22:24.097 --> 01:22:25.655
I want to say that
I love you both.

01:22:29.206 --> 01:22:30.207
Very much.

01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.486
And I want you to promise me,

01:22:35.687 --> 01:22:37.287
that you're gonna tell my child,

01:22:39.926 --> 01:22:43.293
that you're gonna tell my child
how much they're loved every day.

01:22:44.535 --> 01:22:46.389
and remind them
how lucky they are,

01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:48.690
to be free.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.412
Because we are.

01:22:53.284 --> 01:22:54.576
We're free now.

01:22:56.077 --> 01:22:57.177
Finally.

01:22:59.777 --> 01:23:00.777
We're free.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
